A Serverless v1.x plugin to making building Go easy!

This is for you if you don't want to maintain a separate build script, indirect serverless handler definitions, and want the easiest Go serverless experince!

## Features

 - Runs build for all go files listed as handlers (no separate build script!)
 - Specify go files _or_ packages _or_ Public Functions directly (instead of binaries)
     + Allows specifying packageName.FunctionName as function handler
 - Runs go tests
 - Can start serverless plugins before tests
     + eg: S3 or Dynalite test server - these intialize resources based on yaml file
 - Individually packages each function for minimum lambda code size
     + Instead of sending one zip up with all binaries
 - Heavily customizable!
     + Doesn't even have to build Go!

## Installation
```bash
npm install --save serverless-go-build
```

## Usage

 - `serverless build` : Builds _all_ Go binaries listed as function handlers
 - `serverless build --function getWidget` : Builds specific Go binaries
 - `serverless test` : Runs tests specified in serverless.yml
     + Passes in Environment variables `GO_TEST=serverless` and `stage=testing`

`serverless deploy` will *not* run the builds - run `serverless build` first.

### Example `serverless.yml`

```yaml
service: myService
plugins:
  - serverless-go-build
custom:
  go-build:
    # Example where we start "serverless-dynalite" prior to testing
    testPlugins:
      - dynalite:start
    # Run tests defined in endpoints module/folder
    tests:
      - ./endpoints
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: go1.x
  stage: ${opt:stage, 'testing'}
package:
  individually: true
  # No need to include / exclude globally as each function
  # specifies it's include / exclude
functions:
  getWidget:
    # In this case this file must be a main package with main()
    handler: entrypoints/widget/get.go
    name: myService-${self:provider.stage}-getWidget
    events:
      - http:
          path: widget
          method: get
  postWidget:
    # In this case this file must be a main package with main()
    handler: entrypoints/widget/post.go
    name: myService-${self:provider.stage}-postWidget
    events:
      - http:
          path: widget
          method: post
  getPiece:
    # Shows how to call into a modules public function
    handler: piece.GetPiece
    name: myService-${self:provider.stage}-postWidget
    events:
      - http:
          path: widget
          method: post
```

## Customization
You can override any of these fields inside of `custom.go-build`:
```js
{
  // Prefix used for building for AWS
  awsbuildPrefix: 'GOOS=linux ',
  // Build command - followed by bin dest and input path
  buildCmd: `go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o %2 %1`,
  // Test command - followed by value in tests array below
  testCmd: `stage=testing GO_TEST=serverless go test %1`,
  // Path to store build results
  binPath: 'bin',
  // Runtime to require
  runtime: "go1.x",
  // The path to aws-lambda-go/lambda - autogenerated include in main.go
  // (needed when referring to module/PubFunction)
  pathToAWSLambda: "github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda",
  // Path to put generated main.go files (module/PubFunction)
  generatedMainPath: "generatedEntrypoints",
  // Location of go path - needed for (module/PubFunction)
  // Must point fully to the /src segment of the path
  // (By default pulls it from $GOPATH)
  goPath: undefined,
  // Pass this to minimize the package uploaded to just the binary
  // for that endpoint
  minimizePackage: true,
  // Test plugins to start before running 
  testPlugins: [],
  // Delay in milliseconds between starting plugins and starting tests
  testStartDelay: 0,
  // Array of tests to run
  tests: [],
}
```


## Coming Soon 
Will support in the future:
 - `serverless test` command supporting running individual test
 - Building locally vs for AWS

## Important Notes
 - If you override `package` for a function you must include the bin file
     + We do not override package or add to it if you specify it explicitly
